# Jump Hud - Custom Hud elements for jump stats

# Features
* `Constant Speed` - A display of your speed in real time, also prefixing a + or - depending on the difference to your previous speed.
* `Strafe Speed(JSS)` - A metric to how your strafe speed differs to the ideal strafe speed.
* `Strafe Analyzer` - A addition that shows an arrow indicating that your strafe is too fast or too slow.
* `Customization` - You can customize how this appears on your screen vastly. You can change the color rendered on the messages based on your speed or gain for that jump. You can change between if a less important range of jumps are color coordinated based on speed values.

# jhud3 
This isnt gonna be a pull-request to the normal jhud due to there isnt any way to toggle the features i made on/off, and some of it is kinda scuffed.
This is called jhud3 due to its a little bit different from the normal jhud, and there is already a fork called jhud-2.

* `Sync` - i added sync right beside the gain.
* `csgo-port` - I added new numbers to the jhud, so it fits cs:go, i also changed the normal 16th jump where it would show an color based on speed to the 12th jump.
* `css-only` - I added a livegain to the constant speed setting, showing ur gain in a more "real-time" version, i had some mixed player-feedbacks about that part.

* this is just things from ssj that i copied into jhud and i wanted to share it with other people, some of the changes is probably not even needed
